A single uranium fuel pellet — roughly the size of a gummy bear — contains as much energy as one ton of coal, 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, or 149 gallons of oil. Today, more than 440 reactors operate across 32 countries, generating roughly 10% of the world's electricity around the clock, with near-zero carbon emissions.",

The process is elegantly simple: split atoms to make heat, use heat to make steam, use steam to spin a turbine, and the generator converts that motion into electricity. The water that absorbs the heat never leaves the reactor building — it transfers energy through a steam generator to a separate water loop, adding an extra layer of safety.",

Routine fossil-fuel combustion kills far more people every year through air pollution than all nuclear accidents in history combined. Nuclear waste, often cited as an unsolved problem, is better described as a managed engineering challenge: all U.S. spent fuel from more than 60 years of commercial reactor operation would fit on a single football field, stacked less than 10 yards high.
